<p ng-init="tabList=['Form', 'View', 'HTML']" class="lead">This example shows how to let AngularJS
validate input fields from a Django Form in a DRY manner.</p>

<p>The Django <code>forms.Form</code> class offers many possibilities to validate a given form.
This for obvious reasons is done on the server. However, while typing, it is unacceptable to send
the form's content to the server for continuous validation. Therefore, adding client side form
validation is a good idea and commonly used. But since this validation easily can be bypassed by a
malicious client, the same validation has to occur a second time, when the server receives the
form's data for final processing.</p>
<p>With <strong>django-angular</strong>, we can handle this without having to re-implement any
client side form validation. Apart from initializing the AngularJS application, no JavaScript is
required to enable this useful feature.</p>

<div ng-show="activeTab==='Form'">{% pygments "forms/client_validation.py" %}</div>
<div ng-show="activeTab==='View'">{% pygments "views/client_validation.py" %}</div>
<div ng-show="activeTab==='HTML'">{% pygments "tutorial/client-validation.html" %}</div>
<p class="bg-info">Here the differences to the <em>Classic Subscription</em> example is, that the
Form now additionally must inherit from the mixin class <code>NgFormValidationMixin</code>.
Furthermore, the browsers internal Form validation must be disabled. This is achieved by adding
the property <code>novalidate</code> to the Form's HTML element.</p>
